##Tic Tac Toe

A flexible Tic Tac Toe implementation using es6, babel, browserify and grunt.

The focus here was to write functional and generic code to show how Tic Tac Toe can easily become Connect 4, which
could potentially become a Match 3 game. Each game type is defined in a simple config hash.

Run `grunt` to watch for saved files which will transpile the es6.
